                In the early 1990s, the Web was simply a research network that consisted of a few web pages that
                consisted of numerous lines of text. The internet was for academics, researchers, and scientists. It was
                very useful to those that were using it, but not everyone had the knowledge to use it. That is when Marc Andreessen decided to make the web
                easier to use by adding audio and visual capabilities to browsing the internet. The product of their
                efforts became the worldâ€™s first graphical point-and-click web browser, Mosaic.
                Andreessen and his colleagues made their software available to the public for free. At that point, the
                internet was no longer an exclusive platform for scientists and programmers, but rather a platform for
                the world. The only thing that Andreessen needed to make a global impact was money.
            </p>
            <h2>Fight for Survival</h2>
            <h4>It's All About the Winning</h4>
            <p>
                At around the same time, Microsoft and
                Bill Gates were tightening their grip on the Web
                and computer
                industry. While the world viewed the internet as a wide-open road with no horizon, Bill Gates and
                Microsoft believed that access to the vast information on the internet should be controlled through the
                Microsoft Network. However, time would prove that things would not be that easy for Microsoft and Bill
                Gates. That is when  Jim Clark reached out
                to Andreessen and his colleagues to found what would be the fastest-growing software company the world
                has ever seen, Netscape Communications. The plan
                was to take Mosaic to the next level, and build a browser that was more powerful and dominant. Netscape
                perceived Microsoft as their only competition, and their new browser launched publicly under the name of
                 Navigator.
            </p>



            <h2>Navigator</h2>
            <h4>Who will win</h4>



        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="break">
        <h6>
            Hook or Crook
        </h6>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="main-bottom">
            <h4>Internet Explorer</h4>
            <p>
                Navigator was an instant success when 90% of the people that were using Mosaic instantly switched over
                to Navigator. Bill Gates and his elves were shocked and worried. Bill Gates realized the need to rectify
                his position and decided to go head to head with Netscape and declared a <i>Browser War</i>. After both
                companies failed to agree to work together, Netscape decided to go public as a company and officially
                became the fastest growing software company on the market. The war between the two companies was public
                and Andreessen was bad-mouthing Microsoft and Bill Gates on the media. So in 1995, Microsoft answered
                back and published a web browser of their own,
                    Internet Explorer.
